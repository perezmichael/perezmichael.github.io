<h2>HOP</h2>

<p>How many times have you been exploring someplace new when you think to yourself “Wow, I could really use a drink. I wonder what Happy Hour specials there are around me?” </p>

  <h5>THE CHALLENGE</h5>
  <h2>THE JACK OF ALL TRADES</h2>
  <p>For this project I was the sole designer handling Branding, Visual Design, and User Experience. I worked with an Android and iOS developer to create requirements, make decisions, and develop the app. </p>

  <h2>SOO WHAT ABOUT THE USERS?</h2>
  <p>I suggested we start the project with my personal favorite form of research: Personas.</p>
  <p>This team was new to Personas, and wasn’t completely convinced at first, so I quickly sketched a Proto Persona to sell them on their long-term value. </p>
